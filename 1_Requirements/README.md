# CALCULATOR APPLICATION 
# INTRODUCTION 
A fully featured scientific calculator with proper operator precedence is implemented,including trig functions and logarithms , factorials, 12 levels of parantheses , logs to base 2 bitwise logical operators, hex, octal , binary and ASCII display 
# SWAT ANALYSIS 
# Strength 
Calculator can solve complicated problems quickly and in efficient manner Calculators gives more accurate results than counting manually 
# Weakness 
People will be so dependent on using calculators for counting people will become lazy because they already have a calculator for counting 
# Future Scope 
Our project will be able to implement in future after making some changes and modifications as we make our project at a very low level 
So the modifications that can be done in our project are: To make it screen touch so no need to touch key buttons and one more change which can we made is to add snaps of the person who use it
